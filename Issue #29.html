<h2>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the<br>
genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange<br>
fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates,<br>
such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social<br>
predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements<br>
for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about<br>
two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to <br>
establish their own.<br></h2>
